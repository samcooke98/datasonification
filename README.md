This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview
This project aims to provide a navigational tool that incorporates the ability to obtain information from the POI, urban city or transport so that decision-making in wayfinding is improved by the awareness of the activity within that place. This app focuses on NSW Transport in obtaining the real-time data to inform information about the train's departure.

## Data
Create a log-in (free) to get access to API key. Navigate to [Trip Planner API](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/trip-planner-apis) 

## Opening the app
Git clone the app into your code editor with terminal and `npm install` the repo.
To start the app, type `npm start` which opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
